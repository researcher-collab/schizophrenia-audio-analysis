# Schizophrenia Audio Analysis Pipeline  
Comprehensive Diarization → Feature Extraction → Machine Learning Classification  
---

This repository contains the full reproducible codebase used in our research on **speech-based detection of schizophrenia**.  
It includes:

1. **Patient-only diarization pipeline** (PyAnnote-based)  
2. **Audio feature extraction pipeline** (MFCC, spectral, prosodic, jitter/shimmer, formants, HuBERT & VGGish embeddings, OpenSMILE eGeMAPS)  
3. **Balanced machine-learning classification pipeline** using Random Forest, SVM, MLP, LSTM, GRU, CNN + Ensemble Voting

This repo is referenced in the corresponding journal submission to provide full transparency, reproducibility, and access to code used in analysis.
